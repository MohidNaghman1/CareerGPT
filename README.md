## ✨ Core Features

-   🗣️ **Stateful & Context-Aware Conversations:** The application remembers context across turns, enabling advanced features like follow-up questions about an analyzed resume.
-   📚 **RAG-Powered Knowledge Base:** The `CareerAdvisor` agent uses a local FAISS vector store to provide accurate, context-aware answers to general career questions.
-   🔎 **Real-Time Job Search:** The `JobSearch` agent integrates with the Tavily Search API to find, analyze, and summarize live job postings from the internet.
-   📄 **Interactive Resume Coaching:** Upload a resume for a detailed analysis, then ask specific questions and get contextual answers from the `ResumeQAAgent`.
-   ✨ **Polished, Modern UI:** A responsive and intuitive user interface built with Streamlit and a custom, professional theme.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get CareerGPT running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CareerGPT.git
cd CareerGPT
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all required packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
You will need API keys from the following services:
-   [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) (for fast LLM inference)
-   [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (for text embeddings)
-   [Tavily AI](https://tavily.com/) (for the job search tool)

Create a file named `.env` in the project root. This file is included in `.gitignore` to keep your keys secure.
```env
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"
TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key_here"
```

### 5. Build the Vector Store
Before running the app, you need to build the local FAISS index from the documents in `/data/career_docs/`.
```bash
python setup.py
```
This will create a `faiss_index` folder in your project root.

### 6. Run the Application
You're all set! Launch the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.
